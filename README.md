## Research Team
Maria Soria, Andrew Awad, Christian Bordeau, and Carlos Quiroz

## Hypothesis
High levels of CO2 emissions, population growth, and large-scale energy production are causing global warming.

## Methodology
1. Find data-sets on CO2 emissions, population, and energy production for each country
2. Join all the data-sets by country into a CSV
3. Utilize Tableau for data exploration / mock-ups
4. Create an HTML page to display visualizations
5. Design visualizations with D3.js, Leaflet,and Canvas.js

## Conclusion
CO2 emissions, population, and energy production all had positive correlations to global warming. The top 10 countries with the highlest levels of CO2 emissions also typically had high populations and produced a great deal of energy. For example China currently has the largest CO2 emissions to date, along with the largest population and energy production. This proves our hypothesis that CO2 emissions, population densisty, and high levels of energy production are making the Earth warmer over time.

# WHAT IS CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING?

## Research Team
Maria Soria, Andrew Awad, Christian Bordeau, and Carlos Quiroz

## Hypothesis
High levels of CO2 emissions, population growth, and large-scale energy production are causing global warming.

## Methodology
1. Find data-sets on Population, CO2 Emissions, and Energy production for each country
2. Join all the data-sets by country into CSV
3. Utilize Tableau for data exploration / mock-ups
4. Create an HTML page to display viz
5. Design visualizations with D3.js, Leaflet, Canvas.js
